# Builder journal (append-only)

One entry per work unit. Format mirrors the methodology's own journal schema in
`spec/journal-and-history.md` — deliberately, so this file is also evidence of what the
pipeline's paper trail should feel like.

## 2026-08-16 — META-001 — build scaffolding

- **Unit:** META-001
- **Inputs read:** `PROMPT.md`, `seed/00-VISION.md`, `seed/01-REQUIREMENTS.md`,
  `seed/02-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `seed/03-ACCEPTANCE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Decisions:**
  - Fresh run, not a restart: `meta/` did not exist and the directory was not a git repo.
  - Default branch renamed `master` → `main` (convention; the methodology's item branches will
    be `wi/<ID>`, so the trunk name needs to be stable and conventional).
  - The build plan is decomposed into ~40 units of one commit each, sized so that losing a
    session costs at most one unit (PROMPT rule 9).
  - Toolchain probe: `python3` 3.12.3, `node` v18, `uv`, `jq` present. Language choice for
    `scripts/` is deferred to META-003 so it can be recorded as an ADR rather than a habit.
- **Commands run:** `git init` (ok), `git branch -m main` (ok), toolchain probe (ok).
- **Gates:** n/a (no gate scripts exist yet).
- **Artifacts produced:** `meta/plan.md`, `meta/CHECKPOINT.md`, `meta/journal.md`,
  `meta/BLOCKERS.md`, `.gitignore`.
- **Result:** META-001 done. Next: META-002.
