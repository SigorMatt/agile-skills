# Builder journal (append-only)

One entry per work unit. Format mirrors the methodology's own journal schema in
`spec/journal-and-history.md` — deliberately, so this file is also evidence of what the
pipeline's paper trail should feel like.

## 2026-08-16 — META-001 — build scaffolding

- **Unit:** META-001
- **Inputs read:** `PROMPT.md`, `seed/00-VISION.md`, `seed/01-REQUIREMENTS.md`,
  `seed/02-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `seed/03-ACCEPTANCE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Decisions:**
  - Fresh run, not a restart: `meta/` did not exist and the directory was not a git repo.
  - Default branch renamed `master` → `main` (convention; the methodology's item branches will
    be `wi/<ID>`, so the trunk name needs to be stable and conventional).
  - The build plan is decomposed into ~40 units of one commit each, sized so that losing a
    session costs at most one unit (PROMPT rule 9).
  - Toolchain probe: `python3` 3.12.3, `node` v18, `uv`, `jq` present. Language choice for
    `scripts/` is deferred to META-003 so it can be recorded as an ADR rather than a habit.
- **Commands run:** `git init` (ok), `git branch -m main` (ok), toolchain probe (ok).
- **Gates:** n/a (no gate scripts exist yet).
- **Artifacts produced:** `meta/plan.md`, `meta/CHECKPOINT.md`, `meta/journal.md`,
  `meta/BLOCKERS.md`, `.gitignore`.
- **Result:** META-001 done. Next: META-002.

## 2026-08-16 — META-002 — verified Claude Code skill format

- **Unit:** META-002
- **Inputs read:** `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/{claude_code_docs_map,skills,hooks,permission-modes}.md`
  (the `docs.anthropic.com` URL in PROMPT.md 301-redirects to `code.claude.com`).
- **Decisions (all recorded in ADR-0001):**
  - Install at **project** level `.claude/skills/<name>/`, not personal.
  - Renderer emits only the six Agent-Skills-spec-legal frontmatter fields by default, so
    rendered skills stay portable; Claude-Code-only fields are opt-in per skill and recorded in
    the dist manifest.
  - `AskUserQuestion` is the confirmed human-question mechanism; `disallowed-tools:
    AskUserQuestion` is the **hard** enforcement of R2's "implement/verify never ask the human".
  - Gate hardness comes from `PreToolUse` hooks (exit 2, or `permissionDecision: deny` with exit
    0). `PostToolUse` cannot block — so no gate may be designed to rely on it.
- **Explicitly not confirmed:** whether a skill invocation itself is a gateable tool call. The
  adapter therefore gates observable side effects (transition script, `git commit`) instead of
  assuming it. Written into ADR-0001 "What could NOT be confirmed" so the adapter cannot silently
  drift into assuming it later.
- **Gates:** n/a.
- **Artifacts produced:** `meta/adr/ADR-0001-claude-code-skill-format.md`.
- **Result:** META-002 done. Next: META-003.

## 2026-08-16 — META-003 — scripting policy + YAML subset reader

- **Unit:** META-003
- **Inputs read:** `seed/01-REQUIREMENTS.md` R3 (validation script runs in the consumer's
  project), `meta/adr/ADR-0001` (rendered frontmatter must round-trip).
- **Decisions:** ADR-0002 — Python 3.9+, stdlib only, everywhere. No `requirements.txt` exists
  and none may be added. YAML is read by `scripts/lib/miniyaml.py`, a reader for a documented
  subset that raises `YamlError` with a line number on anything outside it rather than guessing.
  Rationale: a gate that fails because a package is missing is indistinguishable, to the agent
  running it, from a gate that fails because the work is wrong.
- **Commands run:** `python3 scripts/lib/selftest.py` → `93 passed, 0 failed`, cross-check
  `ran against PyYAML 6.0.1 on 31 inputs`.
- **Discoveries during verification (both were real divergences, both fixed in the reader/tests):**
  - `2e3`: the first implementation coerced it to a float; PyYAML (YAML 1.1) leaves it a string.
    `_FLOAT_RE` now requires a dot, so the two readers agree. Caught only by the cross-check —
    which justifies keeping that layer.
  - `dump_frontmatter("0.1.0")` needs no quotes and round-trips as a string; the test's
    expectation was wrong, not the emitter.
- **Gates:** `scripts/lib/selftest.py` exit 0.
- **Artifacts produced:** `meta/adr/ADR-0002-scripting-and-dependencies.md`,
  `scripts/lib/miniyaml.py`, `scripts/lib/selftest.py`.
- **Result:** META-003 done. Next: META-030.
